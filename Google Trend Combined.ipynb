`pytrends`, because the metric suggests, according to our asseumption, that if an author writes an article about 'flight' it will be more relevant than if the person wrote about 'brexit'. `pytrends` or Google Trend does not provide the actual number of seaches for a topic, making it difficult to determine if the number is high because it truely is relevant for the time period or high because the it always a seached topic. However, while Google Trend has many limitations and makes it difficult to compare topic values, it is still included in the project as a way to enrich the data set. This is done because the value given by Google Trend still gives some kind of indication whether the topic is relevant or not. \n","\n","A final reflection about Google Trend and possible futher work to be done, would be to look into the sources (news agency). Many of the sources are targeting a specific segment. For instance the The Irish Times would not be relevant for the population of Denmark, but highly relevant for the irish people. `pytrends` has a input field for region specification. This step would make the value given by Google Trend more specific for the chosen region. However the downside of this would be that many sources such like reuters, which is a international news agency, would not be able to be reduced to a single area.
