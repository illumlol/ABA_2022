    "The purpose of topic modeling on our dataset is to find keywords/topics for each article to put into Google Trends API to get an insight how popular certaint events were at given timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "For topic modeling will we use BERTopic made by Maarten Grootendorst, which is a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based topic modeling technique. Documentation can be found her: https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of BERTopic is converting the documents to numerical data. This is where BERT are used to extract different embeddings based on the context of the word using pretrained language model. The second step is to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting embeddings to optimize the clusteringprocess. BERTopic does this with the **UMAP** algorithm. After having reduced the dimensionality of the documents embeddings, BERTopic cluster the documents with **HDBSCAN**. Lastly, from the clusters of documents,topic representations are extracted using a custom class-based variation of TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF).\n",

    "We use BERTopic because it extract the different embeddings based on the context of the word, which we can see is important when making topics for articles."
