    "The impact social media platforms have had on the distribution of articles from news outlets has been significant. About half of U.S. adults (53%) say they get news from social media “often” or “sometimes,” and this use is spread out across a number of different sites, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 7, 2020. Among 11 social media sites asked about as a regular source of news, Facebook sits at the top, with about a third (36%) of Americans getting news there regularly. But what articles a shown to which users?[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The facebook algorithm has long been a hot topic what news feed is shown to you. The specific details of how it works is not known, however there are supposedly three main ranking parameters.\n",
    "* 1. Who posted it? Content by people or business affilated with you will be priotized.\n",
    "* 2. The type of content, if you a more prone to click on videos, videos will be shown to you.\n",
    "* 3. Interaction with the post, feed will prioritize posts with a lot of engagement, especially from people you interact with a lot.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "So when an article is shown to the user, a long process has been gone through to pick that exact one. But what determines whether the user will enteract with the article, is it the cover picture, title, news oulet or a combination of all?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will try to explore what is important for news articles on facebook, in order for people to enteract with them. This can be usefull for editors of newspaper to ensure that the articles they choose to share, are the one who will gain the most traction.\n",
    "\n",
    " We will try to built several models to predict the user engangment, with a special focus on article headlines, the cover picture or the news outlet. In order to achieve this several methods has been used: web-scraping, top-modelling, deep learning. The main data file for this project is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/szymonjanowski/internet-articles-data-with-users-engagement, and webscrapes & API usuage has been carried out to supplement the data set.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step of BERTopic is converting the documents to numerical data. This is where BERT are used to extract different embeddings based on the context of the word using pretrained language model. The second step is to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting embeddings to optimize the clusteringprocess. BERTopic does this with the **UMAP** algorithm. After having reduced the dimensionality of the documents embeddings, BERTopic cluster the documents with **HDBSCAN**. Lastly, from the clusters of documents,topic representations are extracted using a custom class-based variation of TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF).\n",

    "We use BERTopic because it extract the different embeddings based on the context of the word, instead of LDA's bag-of-words approach, which we believe can be important when making topics for articles."

And we saw that forcing articles into topics didn't give big enough gain.\n",

    "Another problem with our approach of assigning 3 keywords based on the 3 top words of the assigned article, is that for some topics is the words c-TF-IDF score significant different.

A decision was made to shorten the date format, which originaly was in `YYYY-MM-DD` to simply a `YYYY-MM` format. This reduced the number of dates to two dates (2019-09 and 2019-10). That is why the input of the function is only a single date string. <br>\n",

This step would make the value given by Google Trend more specific for the chosen region.
